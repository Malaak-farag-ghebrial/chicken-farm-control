The Farm needs to control Food, Water, Humidity and Temperature.
## Food
The Food Will need a tank Controlled its gate with Servo motor to ditribute food .
## Water
The Water will need a tank with submersible Pump workin ON when a water level sensor reaches its lower limit and OFF when  water level sensor is satisfying by water.
## Humidity & Temperature
The Humidity and Temperature will need a Fan controlled with DHT11 ( Humidity, Temperature Sensor ).


#### Two Files
There is two files of the same code, each were Writen in different way.
##### The clean was writen with semi SOLID principles ( servo class, Water Pump class, Humidity class ). 
##### The Unclean was writen with spagheti code for no reason ( I don't kno why ).
